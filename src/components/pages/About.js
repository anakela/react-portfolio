                Oh, hello there! My name is Angela, but you can call me Angie. I'm a web designer/developer living in the Hawaiian islands. My goal is to create beautiful, functional, high-converting websites that are easy to use, highly navigable, and accessible to all.
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey toward web design and development began early. Growing up, I loved drawing, which I did all the time. In addition to art, I was also fascinated with technology. I loved gadgets and video games and understanding how they worked. When the Internet became widely available, I found that my technological allure extended to websites and how they were designed. I would spend hours designing layouts and breaking them down into HTML.
            </p>
            <p>
                Needless to say, my desire to combine art with technology led to:

                <li>Studying through UC Berkeley's Coding Bootcamp</li>
            </ul>

                Take a look at <a href="/work">my work</a>, or <a href="/contact-me">contact me here</a>. I look forward to working with you!
